#'   X axis limits for the plots. Must be a named list, so you can specify the
#'   axis limits for every plot. Every element of the list must be a numeric
#'   vector of length 2. Available names for elements are: XSpace - limits for
#'   the X-Space plot YSpace - limits for the Y-Space plot Default is an empty
#'   list - in this case limits are automatically set. Note: For some plots it
#'   is not meaningful to set limits, in this case the set limits are ignored.
#'   Note: We do not support setting lims for the over.time.plots. We think, in
#'   nearly every case the ggplot defaults are fine, and the very rare case you
#'   have to set them, you can you can extract the plots and add your own
#'   limits.
