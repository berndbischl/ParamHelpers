Description: Functions for parameter descriptions and operations
    in black-box optimization, tuning and machine learning. Parameters can
    be described (type, constraints, defaults, etc.), combined to
    parameter sets and can in general be programmed on. A useful OptPath
    object (archive) to log function evaluations is also provided.
